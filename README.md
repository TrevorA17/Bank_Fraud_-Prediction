# Bank Fraud Prediction
Welcome to our Bank Fraud Prediction project! In this project, we aim to develop a predictive model that can effectively identify fraudulent transactions in banking systems. Leveraging machine learning techniques, particularly decision trees, we have trained a robust model using historical transaction data. The model takes various transaction attributes such as transaction amount, location, merchant, customer age, and gender as input features to make predictions about the likelihood of a transaction being fraudulent. We have encapsulated this predictive model into a Plumber API, allowing seamless integration into banking systems or other applications for real-time fraud detection. Whether you're a financial institution looking to enhance security measures or a developer seeking to integrate fraud detection capabilities into your application, our Bank Fraud Prediction API provides a reliable solution. Feel free to explore our project, contribute to its development, or integrate the API into your systems to safeguard against fraudulent activities effectively.
